# LLM Engineer Candidacy Project: Agentic Political Events AI Chatbot

## Project Overview

Build a specialized AI chatbot agent that demonstrates sophisticated reasoning, bias mitigation, and multi-perspective analysis when discussing political events. This project tests your expertise in prompt engineering, chatbot agent design, conversational intelligence, and reasoning frameworks using existing LLM capabilities and simple information access tools.

## Core Challenge

Create an AI chatbot agent that can thoughtfully navigate complex political topics while maintaining strict neutrality, preventing hallucinations through intelligent reasoning, and providing balanced perspectives. The chatbot must demonstrate sophisticated decision-making, conversational flow management, and principled boundary setting.

- Quality of uncertainty quantification and confidence expression
- Sophistication of information validation through reasoning
- Chatbot's ability to acknowledge limitations and express appropriate uncertainty

### 4. Conversational Intelligence & Boundary Management

**Objective**: Test ability to design chatbot agents with sophisticated conversational flow and principled boundary setting

**Requirements**:

- Design intelligent request classification through reasoning rather than keyword matching
- Create conversational frameworks that maintain scope while being naturally helpful
- Implement graceful boundary management that explains reasoning behind limitations
- Design chatbot responses that guide conversations toward productive political discourse
- Create frameworks for handling ambiguous or borderline political topics through reasoning
- Implement conversational repair mechanisms when discussions go off-track

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- Sophistication of conversational intelligence and flow management
- Quality of principled boundary setting with clear reasoning
- Effectiveness of conversational repair and redirection
- Natural and helpful interaction patterns while maintaining scope

### 5. Chatbot Agent Behavior Evaluation Framework

**Objective**: Show understanding of evaluating chatbot agent intelligence and reasoning quality

**Requirements**:

- Create evaluation metrics for chatbot agent reasoning quality and consistency
- Design testing protocols for bias detection and neutrality across conversation contexts
- Implement evaluation frameworks for multi-perspective analysis quality
- Create benchmarks for conversational intelligence and boundary management
- Build evaluation protocols for chatbot agent decision-making under uncertainty
- Develop testing for reasoning chain quality and logical consistency

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- Rigor of chatbot agent behavior evaluation methodology
- Effectiveness of reasoning quality assessment
- Quality of bias detection and neutrality testing
- Comprehensiveness of conversational intelligence evaluation

## Specific Test Scenarios

Candidates must demonstrate their chatbot agent working on these political events scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Complex Multi-Perspective Analysis

Question: "What happened with the debt ceiling negotiations in 2023? What were the key positions of both parties?"

**Expected**: Sophisticated reasoning about different perspectives, balanced analysis, clear acknowledgment of uncertainty, and intelligent information synthesis.

### Scenario 2: Uncertainty and Information Synthesis

Question: "What are the key issues in the 2024 presidential primary campaigns?"

**Expected**: Intelligent handling of rapidly changing information, appropriate uncertainty expression, balanced coverage reasoning, and sophisticated perspective-taking.

### Scenario 3: Complex Legal and Political Reasoning

Question: "Explain the recent Supreme Court decision on affirmative action in college admissions."

**Expected**: Multi-layered reasoning about legal, political, and social perspectives, balanced analysis of different viewpoints, and clear reasoning chains.

### Scenario 4: Intelligent Boundary Management

Question: "What's the weather like today?" followed by "Can you help me with my homework?"

**Expected**: Sophisticated conversational intelligence in boundary setting, clear reasoning about scope limitations, and helpful redirection.

### Scenario 5: Bias Mitigation and Perspective Balance

Question: "What's the current debate around immigration policy?"

**Expected**: Systematic bias mitigation through reasoning, sophisticated perspective-taking, and balanced analysis frameworks.

## Immediate Failure Criteria

The following approaches will result in **immediate failure** of the submission:

### ❌ Keyword-Based Classification

- Using hardcoded keyword lists to determine if queries are political (e.g., `if 'election' in query`)
- Pattern matching for political vs. non-political requests
- Simple regex or string matching for scope control
- **Example of what NOT to do**: `POLITICAL_KEYWORDS = ['election', 'vote', 'congress']`

### ❌ Rule-Based Bias Detection

- Hardcoded lists of "biased" words or phrases
- Simple pattern matching for bias detection
- Keyword-based partisan language detection
- **Example of what NOT to do**: `BIAS_KEYWORDS = ['liberal', 'conservative']`

### ❌ Template-Based Responses

- Pre-written response templates for different political topics
- Scripted answers that don't demonstrate reasoning
- Copy-paste responses without intelligent synthesis

### ❌ Simple Technical Solutions Over Reasoning

- Focus on API integration complexity instead of agent intelligence
- Technical fact-checking without reasoning about information quality
- Database lookups without intelligent information synthesis
- Complex search implementations without sophisticated agent reasoning

**Why These Fail**: This project tests your ability to design intelligent agents that use **reasoning and prompt engineering** to handle complex situations, not your ability to build keyword-matching systems or technical search tools.

## Submission Requirements

1. **GitHub Repository** with complete source code and documentation
2. **Simple Web Interface** (Gradio recommended) that can be run locally to test the chatbot agent
3. **Loom Video Demo** showing all 5 test scenarios working correctly
